- Get videos from quotes on youtube
- Cut the quote into multiple voices
- Get the music from tiktok viral videos
- Get short videos - something that is related to motivation
- Transcribe videos - get a text of the voice
    - In future use the original video from youtube, transcribe it, then use some text to speech service
- Add the overlay text on the video
- Add a logo watermark
- Add a some text, e.g. subscribe, or post number #600
- Publish to youtube, instagram, and tiktok
- Use open ai to generate some nice hashtags and description
- Merge all videos from the same day in one, and publish them to youtube
    - Use the open ai to generate nice description for the videos


Some updates
- Get the videos with not
 text
- Get just the audios from https://www.tiktok.com/@llxcuo
- Remove the original audio from the video
- Add the audio we received from the first videos from that tiktok profile
- Do the rest of the steps as explained above

An IDEA 
- Based on the audio length, merge some audios, then it would be easy to add the audio, the narrative, and subtitle
- Use horizontal orientation videos for youtube?
