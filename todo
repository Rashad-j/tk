- move to using env variables

The plan:

1. automate grabbing video urls from tiktok
2. get a public url for videos from rapidapi so that we can download videos without watermark
3. Use transloadit to download these videos directly
4. Use transloadit to change the video dimensions, length, etc
5. Use transloadit to merge short videos into only one - and download it?
6. Publish the result video to instagram post and reels
7. Publish the result video to youtube videos and shorts
8. Use Cron jobs to run everyday
9. Use Amazon Web Services to run the program
